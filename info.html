    <h3>Who are we ?</h3>
    <dd>We are a group of university students who are passionate about mitigating fake news circulation. We are the first team to launch an online service that identifies the fake news disseminators among Reddit users.</dd>
    
    <h3>Why do we want to develop this extension?</h3>
    <dd>With the development of various online social media platforms, people nowadays become active disseminator instead of passive consumers of information. Although this phenomenon has assisted the news circulation, it also catalyzes the prevalence of disinformation. Thus, we would like to mitigate faking news circulation and let everyone has informed reading experiences. Besides, other social media platforms and broader Internet communities also stand to benefit by adopting our methodology for investigating and mitigating fake news disseminators.</dd>
    
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <dd>Cooperating with Media Bias/Fact Check, every URL's factuality will be checked against their database, and a factuality will be given. There are six rating levels to indicate the factuality of an URL: very high, high, mixed, very low and low. Through our carefully designed rating algorithm, a suspicious user will be flagged if the proportion of suspicious URLs exceeds a certain threshold and you will be informed each time you see this user. Additionally, you can also change the rigor level by clicking "setting" to change to change the level of threshold.</dd>
